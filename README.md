# trading_analysis_dashboard
This is a python based app for technical analysis applied to stocks trading.

I am a quant developer working for trading firms and hedge funds.

This is a pure, just for fun, project to build an open source trading analysis dashboard.

The initial purpose of the project is:
1 dowload multiple tickers historical price data from yfinance
2 crunch numbers with pandas to create additional technical indicators columns to the main dataframe
3 create a table scanner with updated price information
4 create an interactive chart to visualize price movements
5 finally deploy the app to the web
