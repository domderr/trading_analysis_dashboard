This python project's purpose is to create a technical analysis scanner for stocks trading.
A stocks scanner is a powerful traders decision support to select stocks according to custom technical setups among thousands of existing financial instruments.

Steps:

1. Get stocks price data 
2. Create technical indicators
3. Apply technical indicators to the entire stocks universe
4. Produce an interactive table with a linked chart

My benchnark for this project is Tradestation Scanner-Radarscreen or Multicharts Screener
